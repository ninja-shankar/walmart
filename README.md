About:

Walmart, a leading multinational retail corporation, wants to analyze customer purchase behavior, specifically focusing on purchase amounts with customers, gender, and other factors. Using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scipy.stats, I explored the spending habits to determine if there are significant differences between male and female customers, especially during Black Friday. Understanding these differences can help Walmart make better business decisions, tailor marketing strategies, and optimize inventory management to better cater to customer preferences and maximize sales.
Then I used confidence intervals to check the range in which the the value lies for different values.
